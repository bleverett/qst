Here is the changes.

V1.01 (2010): QT4 version original from Blake Leverett <bleverett@gmail.com>
V1.02 (20141122) : Use higher baud rates - This may not work correctly on
windows
V1.03 (20170217) : Use Qt5 and qtserialport package - works with Qt5, and abandons the QExtSerialPort object in favor of QtSerialPort.
The QExtSerialPort object was adopted by Qt and renamed QtSerialPort.
V2.01 (20170621) : TerminalWidget addon and Bug Fixes by Olivier Lutzwiller <all-informatic@free.fr> /
all-informatic.com/blog
    -on select, copy, clear and paste where not handled, making QAction::connect: No
    such signal error
    *Additions:
    -added this file and make_tarball script system based on file VERSION
V2.02 (20170622) : HLed support by Olivier Lutzwiller <all-informatic@free.fr>
    -with the HLed support, bmp files for led are not more needed
    -timer should not be started until device is connected to avoid segmentation Error.     
     This happens for USB devices such as ttyUSB0 when openAtStart was previouly set
     and the device has been physically removed or when rights are not sufficent
     to access to it (need sudo or to be in group dialout)

     who need to be installed in ../3rd-party/qcustomplot is not yet supported
